| Path | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `README.md` | This project brief |
| `seed_data.zip` | 11 CSV files (200,401 viewing records): the only input for Phase 2. Unzip it to get `seed_data/` |
| `queries/workload_30.sql` | The 30 queries for Phase 3 (do not edit) |
| `benchmarks/run_benchmark.sh` | Timing script: 3 runs per query, average, raw plans saved |
| `CHECKPOINTS.md` | Checkpoint dates and the files each one needs (DE and AP repos) |

**Getting started:** **clone this repository and push it into your team's DE repo** (the DE repo you submitted in the form); the steps are in [`CHECKPOINTS.md`](CHECKPOINTS.md). Keep the structure shown in [Repository structure](#repository-structure-submit-exactly-this). Unzip `seed_data.zip` inside your project folder, but don't commit the CSV files. Deadlines are in [`CHECKPOINTS.md`](CHECKPOINTS.md). Then begin with Phase 1.

## Phase 1: Problem statements

Netflix sells monthly **plans** (Mobile, Basic, Standard, Premium) that differ in price, video quality and how many screens can stream at once. An **account** can have up to 5 **profiles**; kids profiles are limited to U/UA7 content. The catalogue has **movies** and **series** (series have seasons and episodes) tagged with genres; some titles are Netflix Originals, and licensed titles eventually leave the service. Every play is recorded in **viewing activity**, profiles rate titles and keep a **My List**, and every month each account is **invoiced**. You have joined the Netflix India data team.

The current database was put together quickly by an earlier team. It has **no documented schema** (only data exports survive), and the product teams are complaining:

| # | Problem reported | Team | Related queries |
|---|------------------|------|-----------------|
| P1 | "Home-screen rows (**Continue Watching, Top 10, My List, genre rows**) render slowly." | Personalization / UI | R01, R03, R04, R06, R22, R25 |
| P2 | "**Title pages, autoplay of the next episode** and search feel laggy." | Playback / Search | R02, R05, R07, W01 |
| P3 | "**Sign-in** with an email typed in different case is slow, and profile switching lags." | Identity | R10, R24, W03 |
| P4 | "The content team's "**episodes nobody watched**" report is always **empty**." | Content strategy | R13 |
| P5 | "**Billing**: retry lists, on-hold accounts, the monthly billing run and dunning job are too slow." | Payments & Billing | R11, R21, W04, W05 |
| P6 | "**Compliance** must prove kids profiles never watch content above their limit, and detect **account sharing**." | Compliance / Trust | R14, R16 |
| P7 | "Analytics (binge sessions, completion rates, device hours, originals, ratings, My List adds) time out, and viewing will grow **20×**." | Content analytics | R08, R09, R17, R18, R19, R20, W02 |
| P8 | "Finance needs **plan revenue and churn** reports; support needs a fast activity console." | Finance / Support | R12, R15, R23 |

**Your job:**
1. Rebuild a correct, well-constrained schema from the data exports (Phase 2).
2. Measure how the 30 most important queries perform today (Phase 3).
3. Make them fast **without changing their results** (Phase 4).
4. Prove the database will survive next year's growth (Phase 5).

**Deliverable for Phase 1** (`docs/01_problem_understanding.md`, at most 1 page):
- For each problem P1–P8, write in your own words what the business needs and which **stakeholder** is affected (member/profile, kids profile, parents, personalization/UI rows, content strategy, payments & billing, finance, compliance, support).
- Classify each problem as **customer-facing / real-time** or **reporting / analytics**. This decides your performance targets later.
- List any assumptions you make.

## Phase 2: Work out the schema from the seed data

You receive **`seed_data.zip`**. Unzip it to get a folder **`seed_data/`** with 11 CSV files, a real export of the production data:

| File | Rows | What it contains |
|------|-----:|------------------|
| `plans.csv` | 4 | Subscription plans |
| `accounts.csv` | 25,000 | Paying accounts (one per household) |
| `profiles.csv` | 75,000 | Profiles inside each account (including kids profiles) |
| `genres.csv` | 15 | Genres |
| `titles.csv` | 3,000 | Movies and series in the catalogue |
| `title_genres.csv` | 5,963 | Genres of each title |
| `episodes.csv` | 20,000 | Episodes of each series |
| `viewing_activity.csv` | 200,401 | Every play from 1 Jan 2025 to 30 Jun 2026 |
| `ratings.csv` | 33,900 | Thumbs down / thumbs up / love ratings |
| `my_list.csv` | 59,992 | Titles saved to each profile's My List |
| `invoices.csv` | 133,057 | Monthly invoices (January–June 2026) |

The first line of every file is the header (column names). Here are the headers and the first rows of each file:

Open the files yourself (a spreadsheet, `head`, or `SELECT` after a quick load into a scratch table) and study the data carefully. **Nobody will give you the CREATE TABLE statements.** Working them out *is* the task.

### 2.1 What you must identify (for every table)
1. **Table name and column names.** Use exactly the file names and CSV headers. The 30 queries depend on them.
2. **Data type** of every column. Choose the *right* type, not just `TEXT` everywhere. Think about money, timestamps with a time-zone offset, yes/no columns, small whole numbers, decimals and short codes.
3. **Primary key.** Is it one column, or a combination? (Look closely at `title_genres`, `ratings`, `my_list`, and what identifies an episode inside a series.)
4. **Foreign keys.** Which column points to which table? What should happen **ON DELETE** (CASCADE, RESTRICT or SET NULL), and why?
5. **NOT NULL vs NULL.** Some columns are empty in some rows. Find out **when** and **why**, and decide which columns must never be empty. Why do some viewing records have no `episode_id`? When are `runtime_min`, `leaving_on`, `cancelled_on`, `next_billing_date`, `phone` and `paid_at` empty?
6. **UNIQUE** columns (natural candidate keys such as emails, phone numbers, codes and handles).
7. **CHECK constraints.** Write at least **12** that the data obeys and the business needs. Look for allowed values (plans, statuses, maturity ratings, devices, rating values), ranges (streams, runtimes, years), and rules tying columns together (movies have a runtime but series don't, a cancelled account has a cancellation date, kids profiles are limited to U/UA7, failed invoices have no payment time, invoices start on the 1st of a month, Originals never leave).
8. **Relationships and cardinalities** (1:1, 1:N, M:N). Draw the **ER diagram** (image + Mermaid code).
9. **Normal form.** Show that each table is in 3NF/BCNF (list its functional dependencies). Point out any column that is *derived or redundant* (hint: `viewing_activity.completed` vs `duration_watched_sec` and runtime; `invoices.amount_inr` vs the plan price; `viewing_activity.title_id` vs the episode's series) and say whether keeping it is justified.

### 2.2 Rules for your schema
- Create every table in a schema named **`netflix`**: `CREATE SCHEMA netflix;` and `SET search_path TO netflix;`
- In this phase create **only constraints**: PK, FK, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK. **Do not create any other index yet.** (PostgreSQL automatically indexes PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE columns; that's allowed. Note which indexes exist.) Your baseline in Phase 3 must reflect a database *without* tuning.
- Your constraints must accept **all** rows of the seed data. If a load fails, either your constraint is wrong or you found a data problem. Explain which in your design doc.

### 2.3 Load the data
Write `sql/02_load_data.sql` using `\copy`, loading tables in the right order (parents before children):

```sql
SET search_path TO netflix;
\copy plans FROM 'seed_data/plans.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true)
-- ... the other tables, in an order that satisfies your foreign keys
ANALYZE;
```

Then verify the row counts match the table above, and run at least **3 integrity checks** of your own (e.g. "nobody watched a title before it was added", "an episode in viewing_activity belongs to the same series as its title_id", "each account has at most 5 profiles"). Paste the results into `docs/02_schema_design.md`.

### Phase 2 deliverables
- `sql/01_schema.sql`: runs top-to-bottom on an empty database without errors
- `sql/02_load_data.sql`: loads all 11 files without errors
- `docs/02_schema_design.md`: data dictionary (table · column · type · constraint · *why*), ER diagram, FDs and normal form per table, integrity-check results, and every data problem you found

---

## Phase 3: Run the 30 queries and record the time

The file **`queries/workload_30.sql`** contains **30 queries**: 25 reads (`R01`–`R25`) and 5 writes (`W01`–`W05`). They're also listed in the [Appendix](#appendix-the-30-queries). **Do not modify them.** If a query fails, your schema doesn't match the seed data; fix the schema, not the query.

### 3.1 How to measure (everyone must use the same method)
- Run each query with `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` and read the **`Execution Time`** at the bottom.
- Run each query **3 times** and record the **average** of the three `Execution Time` values. Keep all three runs in the raw plan file.
- Write queries (`W01`–`W05`) must be measured inside `BEGIN; … ROLLBACK;` so the data does not change.
- Close other heavy applications while measuring, and use the **same laptop** for Phase 3 and Phase 4.

The helper script does all of this for you:
```bash
./benchmarks/run_benchmark.sh <your_database> baseline
# → benchmarks/results/baseline/summary.csv   (avg, median, min, max, scan types)
# → benchmarks/results/baseline/R01.txt …     (full plans of all 3 runs)
```
> ⚠️ One of the 30 queries takes **several seconds** on the seed data. That's intentional. Let it finish, and don't skip it.

### 3.2 Deliverable: the timing table
In `docs/03_baseline_timings.md`, fill this table for **all 30** queries:

| SQL Query | Type | Run 1 (ms) | Run 2 (ms) | Run 3 (ms) | Average (ms) |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| R01: "Continue Watching" row: the latest unfinished viewing per title for profile 7043 | READ | | | | |
| R02: Title page: seasons of series 2909 with the number of episodes in each | READ | | | | |
| R03: "Top 10 in India today" row: most-watched titles on 30 June 2026 | READ | | | | |
| R04: Genre row for a kids profile: Comedy titles rated U or UA7, newest additions first | READ | | | | |

| R22: "Last chance to watch" row: licensed titles leaving in July 2026 | READ | | | | |
| R23: Support console: all viewing activity, newest first, page 6,001 (25 per page) | READ | | | | |
| R24: "Who's watching?" screen: profiles of account 1409 | READ | | | | |
| R25: "More like this": titles sharing at least 2 genres with series 2909 | READ | | | | |
| W01: Player: profile 7043 starts episode S1E5 of series 2909 | WRITE | | | | |
| W02: "+ My List": profile 7043 adds series 2523 | WRITE | | | | |
| W03: Account settings: account 1409 downgrades to the STANDARD plan | WRITE | | | | |
| W04: Monthly billing run: create July 2026 invoices for every active account | WRITE | | | | |
| W05: Dunning: put active accounts whose latest invoice failed on hold | WRITE | | | | |
| **Total (sum of all 30)** | | | | | |

Below the table, add for each query the **scan type** from the plan (Seq Scan, Index Scan, …) and one line on **why** it is slow or fast.

---

## Phase 4: Optimize the queries

Make the queries faster. **The results must stay the same** (same rows; order matters only where the query has an `ORDER BY`).

### 4.1 Techniques you may use
| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| B-tree index (single / composite) | the right column **order** matters: equality columns first, then range/sort |
| Partial index | index only the rows a query needs (e.g. a rare status) |
| Covering index | `INCLUDE (...)` so the table is never visited (Index Only Scan) |
| Expression index | index the exact expression used in `WHERE` |
| GIN index | for `ILIKE '%text%'` (extension `pg_trgm`), arrays or full-text search |
| BRIN index | for huge tables stored in time order |
| Query rewrite | sargable date ranges instead of functions on columns; `NOT EXISTS` instead of `NOT IN`; joins instead of correlated subqueries; keyset instead of `OFFSET` pagination; `UNION ALL` instead of `OR` across columns |
| VACUUM / ANALYZE | fresh statistics and visibility maps |
| Summary table / materialized view | for heavy reports that don't need live data (state how it's refreshed) |

**Not allowed:** changing the data, deleting rows, changing PostgreSQL server settings to hide the problem (e.g. huge `work_mem`, `enable_seqscan = off`), or caching results outside the database.

### 4.2 How to work
1. Put every index in `sql/05_indexes.sql`, each with a comment: **which queries it serves and why this type and column order**.
2. Put rewritten queries in `sql/06_optimized_queries.sql`. Copy `queries/workload_30.sql` and change **only** the queries you rewrite, keeping the `-- @R01` markers.
3. **Prove the results are unchanged** for every rewritten query (compare row counts, plus a checksum or an `EXCEPT` query). Put the proof in your report.
4. Benchmark again with the same method:
```bash
./benchmarks/run_benchmark.sh <your_database> optimized 5 sql/06_optimized_queries.sql
```
> 🔎 **Read the results, not just the timings.** At least one of the 30 original queries returns a **wrong answer** because of a subtle SQL rule about NULLs. Find it, explain it, and fix it. This is worth marks.

### 4.3 Deliverable: the optimization table
In `docs/04_optimization_report.md`:

| Query | Before (ms) | Problem found in the plan | Optimization applied | After (ms) | Improvement | Same result? |
|-------|------------:|---------------------------|----------------------|-----------:|------------:|:------------:|
| R01 | | e.g. Seq Scan on 200k viewing rows | e.g. index on `viewing_activity(profile_id, started_at DESC)` | | e.g. 99% (150×) | ✅ |
| … all 30 … | | | | | | |
| **Total** | | | | | | |

Improvement % = (before − after) / before × 100

Also include:
- **Before/after `EXPLAIN` plans** for your 5 biggest improvements
- **Write overhead:** which write queries got **slower** because of your indexes, by how much, and whether that's acceptable
- **Index storage:** the size of each index you created (`pg_relation_size`) compared with its table
- **Queries you could not speed up**, and why (an honest "this query must read most of the table" earns marks)

---

## Phase 5: Scalability report (large dataset round)

Your optimizations worked on 200,401 viewing records. Next year the business expects **20× the volume**.

By **Thu 19 Nov 2026**, faculty will release **`large_data.zip`**: the same 11 CSV files with about **20× the rows** (≈ 4,008,000 viewing activity, ≈ 2,661,000 invoices, ≈ 1,500,000 profiles, ≈ 500,000 accounts). Until then, work on the design part of the report.

### 5.1 What to do with the large dataset
1. Create a new database. Run **your** `01_schema.sql`, load `large_data/` with your load script (change the folder name only), then run **your** `05_indexes.sql` and `ANALYZE`.
2. Run your **optimized** queries (`sql/06_optimized_queries.sql`). **Do not run the original 30 on the large data.** Some of them could run for a very long time.
   - R23 pages with `OFFSET`; if you replaced it with keyset pagination, explain how the "last seen" value is chosen for the large data.
3. Record the times and compare with your Phase 4 results on the seed data.

| Query | Optimized on seed (ms) | Optimized on large (ms) | Growth (large ÷ seed) | Meets target? | If not, what you changed |
|-------|------------------------:|------------------------:|----------------------:|:-------------:|--------------------------|
| R01 | | | | | |
| … all 30 … | | | | | |

### 5.2 Performance targets on the large dataset
| Query group | Queries | Target (average of 3 runs) |
|-------------|---------|----------------:|
| Real-time / member-facing | R01, R02, R06, R07, R10, R24, W01, W02, W03 | **under 5 ms** |
| Interactive rows, search and ops | R03, R04, R05, R11, R13, R21, R22, R23, R25 | **under 250 ms** |
| Reports and analytics | R08, R09, R12, R14, R15, R16, R17, R18, R19, R20 | **under 5,000 ms** |
| Batch jobs | W04, W05 | **under 2,000 ms** |

If a query misses its target, **find out why from the plan and fix it.** A query that was fast on the seed data can become slow on large data for reasons that only appear at scale. Show the before/after plans for every fix.

### 5.3 Deliverable: `docs/05_scalability_report.md`
1. **Results table** (above), with every target met or explained.
2. **Growth analysis.** Group your queries by how their time grew when the data grew 20×:
   - *stayed about the same* (why? e.g. index lookups grow with log n)
   - *grew about 20×* (why? e.g. they read a fixed *share* of the table)
   - *grew more than 20×* (why, and what you did about it)
3. **What broke at scale** and how you fixed it (plans before/after).
4. **Storage:** total database size, table vs index size, on seed and large data.
5. **Architecture for 100×:** explain with numbers from your own measurements:
   - **Partitioning:** which table, by which column (RANGE / LIST / HASH), and why. Write the DDL for `viewing_activity`, show partition pruning with `EXPLAIN`, and note the primary-key rule for partitioned tables.
   - **Sharding:** Would you shard by account, by profile, or by title? Think about Continue Watching (one profile) vs Top 10 and Originals reports (one title, all viewers). Which queries become cross-shard, and how would you handle them?
   - **Read replicas and caching:** which of the 30 queries you would send to a replica or cache, and which must hit the primary.
   - **Maintenance:** VACUUM/autovacuum settings for `viewing_activity`, archiving old data, refreshing summary tables.
6. **Conclusion:** is your database ready for next year? What are the remaining risks?

## Evaluation (40 marks)

These 40 marks are the DE part of the project: **Query Execution (10)** and **Code Optimization (30)**.
The AP project (20) and your Individual analysis (40) make up the rest of the 100.

| Phase | Criteria | Marks |
|-------|----------|------:|
| | **Query Execution** | **10** |
| 1 | Problems understood, stakeholders and query groups correctly identified | 2 |
| 2 | Correct data types (1), keys and foreign keys with justified delete rules (1), ≥12 meaningful CHECK / NOT NULL / UNIQUE constraints (1), ER diagram + normal-form analysis (1), data loads cleanly + integrity checks (1) | 5 |
| 3 | All 30 queries measured with the required method: 3 runs, average (1), raw plans committed (1), scan type and reason for each query (1) | 3 |
| | **Code Optimization** | **30** |
| 4 | Speed-up achieved with appropriate techniques (6), every index justified (3), results proven unchanged (2), wrong-result query found and explained (2), write overhead and index storage reported (3) | 16 |
| 5 | Large-dataset results with all targets met or explained (4), growth analysis (3), scale-only problems found and fixed (3), partitioning DDL + sharding/replica design backed by your numbers (4) | 14 |
| | **Total** | **40** |

**Integrity rules**
- Every number in your reports must match the raw plan files in `benchmarks/results/`. Copied or invented timings make the whole phase score 0.
- Every member must have commits; the commit history is checked.
- You may use AI tools to learn, but you must be able to explain every index and rewrite in your individual analysis.
